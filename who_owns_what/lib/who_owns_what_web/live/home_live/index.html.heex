  The Milwaukee Landlord Network Project
</.header>

<p class="mt-5 leading-5">
  This project aims to identify networks of landlord-owned homes in Milwaukee using the names and addresses listed in public records of property ownership and business registration.
</p>

<p class="mt-5 leading-5">
  Here is a simple example of how it works. Pretend there are three properties, each with a different owner name:
</p>

<ul class="list-disc mt-5">
  <li>There are three owner names â€“ John Doe, John A. Doe, and Doe Props LLC, each represented by a blue square.</li>
  <li>Each own one property, and all use the mailing address 123 Main St, Chicago, IL. It is represented by the green triangle in the center of the graph.</li>
  <li>Doe Props LLC uses that same address in their corporate registration, indicated by the red dot.</li>
  <li>Despite using different names, these properties are connected to form a network because they use the same ownership addresses across all of their public records.</li>
</ul>
