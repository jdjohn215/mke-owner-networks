We identify `r d$value[1]` total landlord-owned parcels. The original data includes `r d$value[15]` unique owner names using `r d$value[16]` addresses.

After applying our network matching process, we find a total of `r d$value[3]` owner networks. Of those networks, `r d$value[5]` own just a single parcel, while `r d$value[9]` own not only multiple parcels but also include multiple ownership names.

Of all the residential parcels in the city, `r d$value[14]` are part of an ownership network which includes multiple owner names.

The most recent parcel ownership records were updated by the City of Milwaukee on `r d$value[17]`. We last checked for new updates on `r d$value[19]`. Corporate registration data was last updated on `r d$value[18]`.
